# BiGraph applied to breast cancer sets for tumor microenvironment pattern discovery
 
 This directory contain jupyter notebooks that showcases the application of BiGraph method on breast cancer patients for prognosis-relevant tumor microenvironment pattern discovery. 
 
 The codes can be used to reproduce some of the results published in ``Bi-level Graph Learning Unveils Prognosis-Relevant Breast Tumor Microenvironment Patterns''.

 The organization is the following:
 - (1) Dataset exploration
 - (2) Cellular graphs
 - (3) TME pattern discovery
 - (4) Inter-patient similarities
 - (5) Population graph and patient subgroups
 - (6) Prognosis-relevant patterns
 - (7) Validation and generalization
