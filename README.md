# Bi-level Graph Learning Unveils Prognosis-Relevant Breast Tumor Microenvironment Patterns
BiGraph is an unsupervised learning method for multi-scale discovery of tumor microenvironments (TME). It relies on the construction of a bi-level graph model: (i) a cellular graph, which models the intricate tumor microenvironment, and (ii) a population graph that captures inter-patient similarities, given their respective cellular graphs, by means of a soft Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) subtree kernel.
